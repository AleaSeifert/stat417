## Introduction
<!-- Provide a brief description of the data set you have selected, i.e. the variables, how the study
was conducted, and any other details you can provide. If you collected your own data, then describe how the data were collected and how (right) censoring could occur. Be sure to define the time-to-event variable and how right censoring could occur. -->

## Main Report

#### Parametric Survival Analysis
<!-- Through approaches we have discussed in the class, find a probability distribution that best fits your time-to-event data. Explain why the particular distribution was chosen. Once you have determined a probability distribution, construct the survival function and hazard function for all individuals in the data set and describe your observations. In addition, examine the survival and hazard functions for different groups of interest and report what you observe. Finally, report the mean and median survival times for all individuals and for the various groups you have examined. -->

#### Non-parametric Survival Analysis
<!-- Use non-parametric methods to describe and compare survival experiences of the different groups in your data set. Examine and comment on the survival experience of all individuals in your data set, as well as the survival experiences of different groups of individuals. Use graphical displays such as Kaplan-Meier curves, and/or estimated hazard curves, and perform and report results of the log-rank test. In addition, compute various descriptive statistics of interest. Finally, compare some of your findings using the non-parametric approaches to your findings using the parametric approaches. -->

#### Regression Analysis
<!-- Develop a Cox regression model to investigate the associations of the predictors (explanatory variables) with the hazard rate. You need only present your final model, including, but not limited to, parameter estimates, standard errors, and p-values. Discuss whether model assumptions have been met and whether you removed any influential or outlying cases. Be sure to present the residual diagnostic plots to support your discussion. Then for some key values of the predictors, present estimated hazard ratios and confidence intervals for the corresponding true hazard ratio. Provide interpretations of the hazard ratios -->

## Conclusion
<!-- Summarize and discuss any insightful discoveries about the time-to-event data and your most important findings. -->

## Appendix
<!-- Include all R code used to conduct your analyses in the Appendix at the end of the report. -->
